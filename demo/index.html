            ## 1. What does this plugin do?

            - its main goal is to reinforce social presence in online learning
              - both in synchronous and asynchronous learning
            - it has its own user management
            - for each set of (lecture) slides, an instructor can create a virtual room
            - then all can learn together
          </textarea>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>On the bottom, you see a table of contents.</p>
            <p>It is generated by the plugin <a href="https://github.com/e-gor/Reveal.js-TOC-Progress" target="_blank">toc-progress</a></p>
            <p>Again, this plugin and this plugin can co-exist without any issues.</p>

              ## 3. Setup

              - simply follow the plugin's README instructions and install the plugin
              - within your presentation, you can see controls on the top left corner of your screen.
              - click on the user icon and register yourself.
              - then, login to the backend's admin panel and modify your user to be `instructor`

              ## 3.1. Virtual rooms

              - virtual rooms are created by instructors
              - they are bound to the exact URL of the presentation
              - are identified via an ID
              - in the "participants" view of this plugin, you can copy a shareable link to this room
            </textarea>
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>

              ## 3.2. Configuration

              - the features of this plugin can be enabled or disabled via the `Reveal.initialize` call
              - Simply supply a configuration object to the key `socialPresence` in your reveal.js config

              ## 4. List of features
  
              - every virtual room is bound to a specific presentation by its URL
              - instructors can create them from inside the presentation by using the "+" button after logging in
              - other users can join them via an invite link (that can be copied from the participants view) or by entering the room ID in the "Join Room" dialog
              - thus, any contribution to a room is bound to a specific presentation
            </textarea>

              ### 4.1. Global chat

              - the first control on the top left corner is the global chat
              - all users can exchange messages, and reply to each other
              - the messages appear in real-time like in any chat application
              - instead of notifications, when not on the chat view, you see a badge with the number of unread messages (not persistent, but as long as you are logged into a room)

            <textarea data-template>
              ### 4.2. Groups

              - unlike with rooms, groups can be created by any user
              - they allow a smaller group of users out of the room's participants to engage in private conversations
              - users can join via a code that can be copied from the "Members" section of the group
              - users can only be in one group per presentation and room
            </textarea>
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            <textarea data-template>
              ### 4.3. Participants

              - users can see all participants of a room and their online status
              - by hovering on any visible user icon, they can see their username, avatar, and short bio
              - by clicking on a specific participant in the list, you follow them to their currently viewed slide
              - additionally, when configured in your personal settings, you can see the cursors of other participants which are also on your slide
              - another extra is visible when opening the overview of the presentation:
                - you can see the amount of users on each slide in a small badge in their left bottom corner
            </textarea>
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            <textarea data-template>
              ### 4.4. Social annotation

              - similar to [hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is), users can highlight content of the slides and annotate them
                - a portion of the mature techniques and algorithms used by hypothesis are used here as well
              - As long as users are selecting content on the slides, they can easily annotate them with a comment that opens a discussion thread, other users can reply to
            </textarea>
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>

                - display name
                - avatar
                - short bio
                - profile color (that determines colored borders around their profile and their cursor color)
            </textarea>
          </section>

          <section data-markdown>
            <textarea data-template>
              ### 4.6. Individual settings

              - users can change their individual settings
                - toggle visibility of the cursors of other participants
                - toggle whether only cusors of group members should be shown
                - toggle visibility of annotation highlights
              - enable a "Zen Mode" that disables all visual cues and limits the UI to one control button
                - limits distraction

              ## 5. Privacy concerns

              - users are only visible within the rooms they have joined
              - users are free to leave the rooms, but their contributions and the association to them remains
              - when users delete their account, their contributions remain,
                but their data deleted and the author of their contributions is anonymized
            </textarea>
          </section>

              ## 5.1. Technical details

              - users stay logged in via cookies and a refresh token (http-only cookie)
              - as long as they do not login on another domain, they stay logged in
              - via `localStorage`, the last room they were in is remembered
              - additional individual user settings are also stored locally in `localStorage`
